# Weight Predictor
## Univariate Linear Regression Model for Predicting Weight based on Height

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple univariate linear regression model that predicts weight based on height. The heights and weights dataset obtained from Kaggle is used for this purpose.

<i>This project constitutes the first part of my assignment for The Machine Learning & Deep Learning Show 2022.</i>
## Tech Stack

Python 3, NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib



## Problem Statement
 Implement a Univariate Linear Regression after finding your own data  
 
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the heights and weights dataset obtained from Kaggle. This dataset contains height and weight information for a group of people, and is used to train the univariate linear regression model.

## Code

## Usage

You can run the code by opening the univariate_linear_regression.ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook and running the code cells. The code is well-documented and should be easy to follow.
