## Univariate Linear Regression Model for Predicting Weight based on Height

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple univariate linear regression model that predicts weight based on height. The heights and weights dataset obtained from Kaggle is used for this purpose.

<i>This project constitutes the first part of my assignment for The Machine Learning & Deep Learning Show 2022.</i>

## Problem Statement
 Implement a Univariate Linear Regression after finding your own data  
 
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the heights and weights dataset obtained from Kaggle. This dataset contains height and weight information for a group of people, and is used to train the univariate linear regression model.

## Code
[Link to Code](https://github.com/manisha-nair28/Weight-Predictor/blob/main/Weight_prediction.ipynb)
## Usage

You can run the code by opening the [Weight_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/manisha-nair28/Weight-Predictor/blob/main/Weight_prediction.ipynb) file in a Jupyter Notebook and running the code cells. The code is well-documented and should be easy to follow.
